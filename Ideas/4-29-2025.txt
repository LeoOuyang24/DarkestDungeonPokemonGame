creatures have very limited movesets, still 4 maximum moves but only two are usable in teh beginning.
	Level max is considerably lower, (say, 10?)
	Moves 3 and 4 are learned at levels 5 and 10 respectively
	No moves past the initial 4
	Most creatures have SwapPos as their 2nd move
	Leveling up is much more expensive

Only one damage type (for now)

Status effects that incentivize stacking them to high amounts:
	Burn: all stacks consumed at the end of the turn and deals damage equal to stacks, doubled if 10+ stacks
	Frost: Speed is reduced by the amount of stacks, if at 10 stacks, the creature is frozen and skips its turn
	Shocked: Adjacent creatures take (half?) stack damage at end of turn
	Radioactive: Applying radioactive to a creature that already has stacks multiplies the stacks by the applied amount:
		example: Creature with 3 stacks receiving 4 more stacks instead now has 12 stacks
		
Rare creatures that can only be scanned under certain conditions:
	Scannable only if it's the last remaining creature
	Scannable only at a certain amount of health
	Scannable only in certain positions?
