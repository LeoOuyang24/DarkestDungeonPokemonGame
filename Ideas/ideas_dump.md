# Ideas dump
just a document for me to write down some ideas.

## Creatures
- Creature that can swallow a creature whole, temporarily disabling both the user and the target
- Creature that resembles a floating rectangular brick structure with chains dangling down
- Extremely overstatted creature with the downside of being asleep for one turn 
- Creature that gets stronger ever turn it doesn't take damage
- Creature that fills the "assassin" archetype: fast and strong but very fragile and can target specific enemies
- Reptilian creature that can evolve infinitely
    - maybe the sprite changes as it evolves
- rare sapient creatures:
    - "Masked" Creature that after dropping below a certain health, reveals a face resembling the player's previous character. Can evolve into all other sapient creatures
    - creature that copies all stat changes, positive and negative, that are happening
    - creature that copies all healing done 
    - creature that copies the opposing creature in the same corresponding slot

## Mechanics

### Status effects
- Sleep: Creature is unable to act. Creature wakes up after 3 turns or when it takes damage
- Burn/Poison/Melting: Creature takes damage every turn
- Paralysis: Creature's speed is stuck at 0, so they always go last

### Moves
Cooldowns: to prevent moves from being spammed (and to allow to us to create really powerful moves without breaking the balance), they may need a cooldown, which is the number of turns before they can be used again. A cooldown of 0 can be used every turn, a cooldown of 1 means every other turn, and so on. Alternatively, there could be a PP system like in Pokemon which allows moves to be spammed but gives the users very limited usage and forces the user to control their own spamming.

This will be referred to as a **limiting factor** for the rest of the document

- Shoot: A very basic, moderate damage move that the player character can do. It doesn't do much damage and has a high limiting factor but is able to target any enemy regardless of position and is by far the most common way the player character can do damage.

- Passive Moves: Passive, constant effects that take up the slot of a move but can't be eplicitly used

### Artifacts
Equivalent to held-items in Pokemon

- Enhancer: doubles the effect of the items held by adjacent allies

### Items
Single-use items that the player can use on their turn.

- Potion: Heals a creature

### Progression
The main currency for the game will be DNA (name pending). It is used to **level up** creatures, **mutate** them, and buy things

- Level Up: Increase's a creature's stats. Unlike in Pokemon where leveling up might take a lot of exp, a level will only take a couple DNA; early on, a single DNA may be required. As Creatures level up the amount to level up will also increase.

- Mutate: Basically Pokemon Evolution. Not every creature mutates but those that do can do so after reaching a certain level. Mutating them turns them into a totally different creature with (usually) higher stats of the same level.

- Buying: There will be a store mechanism of some kind, it'll likely be an [event](#Events). 

    - Gold: It might make sense to have a currency purely for buying things. 

### Capturing Creatures
**Capture** will be a move exclusive to the Player creature, which randomly targets an enemy. Once "captured" a creature is either:
    - usable immediately afte the battle is over
    - The player gains access to the creature's DNA and can construct a copy after the battle
Not sure which one I like more.

### Events
Events are non-combat nodes on the map.

- Wells: Players can choose to **drink** (heal their whole team for 25), **drink deeply** (heal themselves for 65%), or **study** (gain some amount of DNA)

- Store: PLayers are approached by a mysterious entity. I'm still working out exactly what they can buy or what to use when buying but here are some ideas:
    - Creatures
    - Artifacts
    - Items
    - If there is a different currency for buying things, the player can buy DNA

- Shortcuts: The player fights a literal wall; breaking it with a certain number of turns creates a shortcut to a later portion of the map.
    - The wall is an uncapturable Creature that periodically does damage; maybe parts of the ceiling fall and hit all creatures?





## Lore
Ancients were the first intelligent race on Earth and were experimenting with ways to communicate and preserve an idea for thousands of years (think [nuclear waste messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_nuclear_waste_warning_messages)). They built a laboratory where they experimented with the idea of genetic information since that gets passed down generation to generation but ended up creating a highly mutated DNA virus that decimated their population, eventually leaking out of the lab and creating life as we know it.

The Womb of God is the laboratory where this all happened.
The creatures in the Womb of God were the Ancients' creations.

### Unanswered Questions
- How did the ancients procreate? Does it matter?
- Should the players encounter the Ancients?
- Should we incorporate other methods of information passing down, i.e. passing down ideas culturally or through teaching
    - Should we stick with purely biological methods?
- What were the Ancients trying to communicate?

### Other Lore Ideas
- Crowhurst was going to try and win the race to sail around the world but it quickly became apparent that he was not gonna survive. To save face, his plan was to sneak in behind the other competitors, losing the race but still pretending to finish. He had fabricated his captain's log and had hoped that being in last place would bring enough obscurity to conceal his lies. Indeed one sailor did finish but Crowhurst and the remaining competitor were still in the running for the shortest actual time spent. But then, the remaining competitor sunk, which meant Crowhurst won by default. Ironically this was terrible because it meant his fake logs would be scrutinized and he'd be found out; him winning was the worst fate possible. Instead of finishing, he drifted into sea and ultimately disappeared.
