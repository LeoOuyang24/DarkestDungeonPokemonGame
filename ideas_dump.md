# Ideas dump
just a document for me to write down some ideas.

### Creatures
- Creature that can swallow a creature whole, temporarily disabling both the user and the target
- Creature that resembles a floating rectangular brick structure with chains dangling down
- Extremely overstatted creature with the downside of being asleep for one turn 
- Creature that gets stronger ever turn it doesn't take damage
- Reptilian creature that can evolve infinitely
    - maybe the sprite changes as it evolves
- rare sapient creatures:
    - creature that copies all stat changes, positive and negative, that are happening
    - creature that copies all healing done 
    - creature that copies the opposing creature in the same corresponding slot

### Mechanics

#### Status effects
- Sleep: Creature is unable to act. Creature wakes up after 3 turns or when it takes damage
- Burn/Poison/Melting: Creature takes damage every turn
- Paralysis: Creature's speed is stuck at 0, so they always go last

#### Moves
Cooldowns: to prevent moves from being spammed (and to allow to us to create really powerful moves without breaking the balance), they may need a cooldown, which is the number of turns before they can be used again. A cooldown of 0 can be used every turn, a cooldown of 1 means every other turn, and so on. Alternatively, there could be a PP system like in Pokemon which allows moves to be spammed but gives the users very limited usage and forces the user to control their own spamming.

This will be referred to as a **limiting factor** for the rest of the document

- Shoot: A very basic, moderate damage move that the player character can do. It doesn't do much damage and has a high limiting factor but is able to target any enemy regardless of position and is by far the most common way the player character can do damage.
